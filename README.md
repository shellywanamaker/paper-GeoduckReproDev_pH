## Overview
### Broodstock conditioning
- After being held at ambient conditions for 18 days (20181025 - 20181112), broodstock were conditioned under ambient and constant low pH conditions (pH 6.8) for x days beginning 20181112 and ending 20190221. 
	- hemolymph samples were taken x times during the course of the conditioning.
	- respirometry measurements were taken a total of 3 times on x, x, and x.
	- gonad histology was done on 10 individuals from each treatment on 20190123 and on 24 individuals (13 from ambient, 11 from low pH) on 20190221.
	- qPCR was done to measure expression levels of reproductive development associated genes in hemolymph cells
