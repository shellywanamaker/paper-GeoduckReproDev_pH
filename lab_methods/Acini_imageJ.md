(1)	Draw around the acini using the freehand selection tool.   
	Cntrl+M to measure     
Cntrl+T to record ROI.   

(2)	Press Edit -> Clear Outside to isolate your selection 

(3)	Image ->  Adjust ->  color Threshold to open the color threshold window

(4)	Change Hue, Saturation, and Brightness to measure the following:     
-	Lumen – the pink area inside the acini     
-	Spermatozoa - dark blue sperm cells found close to the lumen     
-	Spermatocytes and spermatozoa – all blue area including the sperm cells near the lumen and the circular spermatocytes (lighter blue shade) that cover the majority of the acini area.   
-	 
After each….   
-	Cntrl+M to measure.   
-	Cntrl+T to record ROI.     

(5)	Add the area values for total area, lumen, spermatozoa, and spermatozoa+spermatocytes to a cumulative spreadsheet
